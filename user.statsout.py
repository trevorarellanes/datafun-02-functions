We are presented with the univariant data set heart_rate which contains data in BPM as follows: [105, 129, 87, 86, 111, 111, 89, 81, 108, 92, 110, 100, 75, 105, 103, 109, 76, 119, 99, 91, 103, 129, 106, 101, 84, 111, 74, 87, 86, 103, 103, 106, 86, 111, 75, 87, 102, 121, 111, 88, 89, 101, 106, 95, 103, 107, 101, 81, 109, 104]

Below are measures of the average and central tendency for the data set
The average is 99.12 BPM, the median is 102.5 BPM, and the mode is 111 BPM

That is an elevated resting heart rate!

Listed below are measures of how spread out the data is:

Variance: 179.25
Standard deviation: 13.39
Lowest heart rate: 74 BPM
Highest heart rate: 129 BPM



=============================================================

Below is the data and results used for our statistical analysis:

xexercise:[65, 45, 45, 50, 10, 0, 0, 15, 25, 60, 50, 65]

yheart_rate:[62, 85, 80, 71, 95, 101, 90, 88, 52, 75, 72, 68]

The correlation between exercise and exercise = 1.00
The correlation between exercise and heart rate = -0.66

The slope is: -0.38
The intercept is: 92.02

Below is the result of inputting the future exercise time of 100min and having our model predict the future heart rate for that value
For the value 100 min of exercise, the predicted heartrate is 54 BPM
